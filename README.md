# Geno

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed
2. Download the code and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. In a new terminal, navigate to the project directory and run `npm run electron` to start the Electron app.
    - If the new application window is blank, wait a few seconds to allow the development server to start and reload by going to View > Reload

The application will automatically reload after making changes. You can open the console to view logs/errors: View > Toggle Developer Tools.

Geno requires the corresponding [backend server](https://github.com/Dingln/geno_server) to be running for training and using voice models.
